# Digital-Lock
The digital lock project is a microcontroller-free security system, that relies solely on pure digital logic circuits. It contains a 6-digit password and a 4-digit security code for password changes. Users have two chances to input the correct password, and on the third unsuccessful attempt, a buzzer alerts them of unauthorized access. The system incorporates essential components like demux, registers, and logic gates, ensuring efficient routing, storage, and comparison of input data. The complete circuit is designed using NI Multisim 14.2. This lock offers a robust, cost-effective, and reliable solution for access control in various settings without the need for complex microcontrollers.
